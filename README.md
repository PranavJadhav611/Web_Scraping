# Web_Scraping
This repository contains all programs related to Web scraping from basic to advanced level.

Web scraping exists within a legal and ethical gray area, as its permissibility is contingent on various factors. My current endeavor involves the extraction of data from a specific website, http://quotes.toscrape.com , which has been designed and structured to facilitate such activities. It is essential to operate within the confines of legal frameworks and respect the terms of use outlined by the targeted website to ensure ethical and lawful conduct during the scraping process.

For basic web scraping we will be using BeautifulSoup Python library. 
Beautiful Soup is primarily used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides a convenient way to navigate and search the parse tree created from the HTML or XML content.
Beautiful Soup is focused on extracting data from the structure of a web page. It does not interact with the browser or execute JavaScript. It is suitable for static websites where the content is present in the HTML source code.

For advanced web scraping we will be using Selenium Python library.
Slemium is used for web scraping, particularly for dynamic websites that use JavaScript to load or modify content.
Selenium can interact with dynamic elements, click buttons, fill forms, and perform other actions just like a user would. Selenium is suitable for scenarios where the content is loaded dynamically through JavaScript.
